# UFOs
## Overview

In this analysis we provide data in a web environment that can be filtered by a web-provided filter coded in Javascript. The base data is provided by a small database-like JS file with a data variable that is then reflected on said website. The user just has to input whichever data they are searching for, press a button, and find data that matches their criteria.

## Results

As explained previously, this analysis calls upon a website that provides pre-existing data and is properly formatted with lists and CSS visuals to provide quick and easy data to the user about UFO sightings.
Below, you can see what the website looks like and some of the data it contains and can be worked with:

## Summary

Drawbacks:
* The primary drawback of this website is that it has very limited data, due to this, the user isn't exactly sure what data is contained within it, unless they scroll down and look at it. It would be more intuitive to have a dropdown menu to facilitate the search criterias they might have when inputting something into the filter. That, or a recommended search when they input something that looks similar to a pre-existing entry.
Recommendations:
* Expanding the existing data would be useful as it is currently very limited. This could be done by manual entry or API usage.
* Perhaps at one point after adding more data, specially if website scrapes are involved, the usage of a database would be helpful to store large amounts of data.
